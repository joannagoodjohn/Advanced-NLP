Therefore, we will not include them in the calculation of the (log) probabilities during prediction, under the assumption that their probability does not differ hugely between the different classes (probably not a correct assumption, but the best we can do at this point). Since we don't need correct probabilities but only most likely classes, just ignore unknown words during prediction.\n",

    "Start by implementing a function `featurize()` that converts the (training or testing) data into a matrix format. This function should return a pair of NumPy matrices 𝑿, 𝒀, where 𝑿 is an 𝑁 × 𝐹 matrix (𝑁: number of data instances, 𝐹: number of features), and where 𝒀 is an 𝑁 × 2 matrix whose rows have one of two forms:<br><br>\n",

    "[0, 1] if the gold-standard class for the corresponding document is ‘nonoffensive’<br><br>\n",
    "This kind of representation is known as a one-hot encoding. You can read the first vector as saying that ‘there is a 100% chance that the instance belongs to the “offensive” class and a 0% chance that it belongs to the “nonoffensive” class’, and similarly for the second vector. Note that these are the two extreme cases for the conditional probability distribution P(k|x) for class k and feature vector x.<br><br>\n",
    "To implement the `featurize()` function, you will need to assign to each word in the training set a unique integer index which will identify that component of the feature vector which is 1 if the corresponding word is present in the document, and 0 otherwise. This index is built by the helper function `build_w2i()`.<br><br>\n",
    "Your next task is to complete the implementation of the `MaxEnt` class. The methods `p()` and `predict()` yield the probability of a class given an item, and the best class for the item, respectively. They can be implemented using appropriate NumPy matrix operations and the provided `softmax()` function. Note that you should set up both methods to take a whole matrix of input vectors as input, not just a single vector.<br><br>\n",
    "The training procedure is implemented in the (class) method `train()`, using iterative optimization. Typically, we shuffle the training data and split them into mini-batches (e.g, 100 items), then update the weights after each minibatch. This is done for `max_iter` number of iterations, or \"epochs\". Each epoch iterates over the training data set once.<br><br>\n",
